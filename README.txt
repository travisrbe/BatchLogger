This is an ASP.NET Core 8.0 API created to aid home winemakers in planning and logging the progress of their batches.

This repository has been made public as a code sample, and is not the active repository for this project.

The active repository is hosted in Team Foundation Version Control via Azure DevOps, which I am also leveraging to track development tasks and run build pipelines.
